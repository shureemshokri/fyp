# Progress


As of now, 
 - 13 classes of flowers have been trained, planning to add 7 more classes of flowers.
 - 796 images of flowers.
 - data augmentation have been applied.
 - confusion matrix also have been shown to compare.
 - the model performance is about 85%.
 - UI also have been created, however I am having issue at the moment where my CMD cannot detect my python file, I am fixing it as of now.
 - planning to add simple database to store users information when logging in.


1. the images are in the flower_dataset_extracted file, which contains all classes of flowers.
2. the model is in the other main code.ipynb file
3. the latest model was saved as flower_classification_model_latest.h5
